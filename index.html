        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <div class="story-content">
            <p>
                Our story almost didn't happen. In 2019, Marilyn was arranging a casual meet-up between her best friend and
                a friend she had met through an exercise class, Ian's mate. A "pre-date" to see if they'd get along.
                Ian's friend asked him to come along for moral support. Ian was exhausted that day
                and nearly didn't go, but something told him to make the effort. Best decision ever.
            </p>
            <p>
                The moment we met, we clicked. We realised we recognised each other from work and we'd even
                walked past each other countless times but had never actually spoken. After that evening,
                we connected on Facebook and started chatting about going to a pub quiz together. The meetings kept coming and
                we thrived through Covid lockdowns and all the challenges that came with them, growing
                stronger together through it all. Over six wonderful years later, we now have two
                amazing sons who fill our lives with joy and chaos in equal measure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ian proposed during a traditional Christmas visit to the lights at Longleat.
                Surrounded by the magic and the memories, he asked the most important question of his life.
                Well, at least thats how he imagined it... It was raining, cold, and the kids werent happy
                but months of planning came down to this!
                In front of the steps of Longleat House Marilyn said yes (obviously), and he whisked her off her feet back to the car (with the kids) to get warm and dry. Who said romance was dead?</p>

            <p>We hope our big day has better weather but regardless of what happens we are excited to say "I do" and celebrate the beginning of this next chapter in beautiful surroundings with all of you beautiful people.
